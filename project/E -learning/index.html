            <p class="sectionSubTag text-size=50%" text-align="left"><BR>
                E-learning is a type of learning conducted digitally via electronic media, typically involving the internet.
                
                It can be accessed via most electronic devices including a computer, laptop, tablet or smartphone, making it a versatile and easy way for students to learn wherever they are. E-learning resources come in a variety of forms – from software programmes and digital courses to interactive online platform and apps.
                
                Below are some common types of e-learning methods and the differences between them.<BR>
                
                <BR><b>DIGITAL MATERIALS</b><BR>
                E-learning can be carried out via the consumption of videos, PDF documents, slideshows and word documents. Thanks to the availability of these resources, it’s incredibly easy for anybody to teach themselves a new skill at their own pace.
                
                
                <BR><BR><b> ONLINE COURSES</b><BR>
                Online courses are often provided by Learning Management Systems (LMSs) and allow learning material to be delivered at a steady rate, organised into sections and chunks to make it easier for the learner.
                
                They often come with interactive materials to allow the learner to test and apply their own knowledge.
                
                Popular online course providers include Skillshare and Udemy.
                
                <BR><BR> <b>VIRTUAL TUTORING</b><BR>
                Thanks to the internet, private tutors are no longer as expensive as they once were. Thanks to websites like MyTutor and TutorHub, it’s now easy to find online tutors for any subject at an affordable rate.<BR> Lessons are completed via video communication platforms like Skype and Zoom.
                
                <BR><BR><b> APPS & SOFTWARE</b><BR>
                Apps and software are nothing new, and many people are discovering the amazing possibilities for self-taught learning through apps they can download right to their phone.<BR>
                
                Learn a new language with Duolingo, or try your hand at a musical instrument with Yousician and Uberchord.<BR>
                
                Learning software can also be used both online and off to engage in shared learning courses (as mentioned above) or engage in your own personal learning journey.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-size=20%">e-Learning: The students and the teacher interact online in this type of learning. In this form of learning the students take a course from the teacher without physically visiting an actual classroom with him. Both of them communicate and learn the courses online even if they are on the same premise. Though students can use offline materials like paper to send their response they are connected with their teacher through an internet connection only. They can send the picture of their response online to their teacher.
                    With so many schools across the UK currently closed, teachers and students are taking advantage of e-learning methods to continue their studies from home.

                    <br> Even before this recent crisis, many schools were already strong champions of edtech in the classroom, and creating a seamless and flexible learning experience through the use of digital platforms.
                    
                    <br>There are many ways in which teachers have been implementing e-learning to continue the teaching of their curriculum. One major way is the use of virtual ‘classrooms’ or lessons, using video communication platforms like Zoom. The teacher is able to plan and teach lessons as normal, with all students attending the lessons from their own home. The great thing about Zoom is that it can be accessed on a phone as well as a computer, adding greater flexibility to students.
                    
                    <br>Teachers have also been able to create and distribute learning materials via platforms like Google Classroom and Edmodo.<br> And when it comes to finding lessons plans and learning materials, there is a whole wealth of shareable resources online.

    <p class="sectionTag text-big"><b>What is the value of E-Learning?</b></p><br>
         <p class="sectionSubTag text-size=20%">Online Learning: The main element of online learning is to get learning experience by using an internet connection. The students have to use certain techniques to get this learning experience. In other words, online learning can be described as the combination of blended learning and e-Learning as it generally uses online tools like ezTalks Cloud Meeting etc. for learning the course.
            Online learning has numerous advantages over traditional learning methods. Some of these include the possibility for students to make use of self-paced learning and to choose their own learning environments. Additionally, e-learning is both cost-effective and cost-efficient, as it removes the geographical obstacles often associated with traditional classrooms and education.

            Taking these benefits and many more into consideration, it becomes evident why the current trends in e-learning show remarkable growth for the industry. Worldwide e-learning revenue is expected to grow to $325 Billion by 2025, which is remarkable considering the fact that the number was three times smaller – $107 Billion, in 2015.
            
            
            With that being said, it must be noted that e-learning is not perfect. Conducting any of the various types of e-learning through the Internet means sacrifices in one way or another. Increased risk of cheating during assessments, social isolation, and lack of communicational skill development in online students are just some of the challenges of e-learning which need to be addressed. Read our separate post on the disadvantages of e-learning in order to get a better overview of the drawbacks associated with e-learning.
